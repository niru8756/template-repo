An open-source **frontend template** for building UniSouk Frontend Store.  

Built using **Next.js**, **Axios**, it follows a clean, modular structure with reusable patterns like **HOCs**, **Context**, and **Helpers** to maintain simplicity, scalability, and ease of integration.

## Getting Started

Create a `.env` file in your project root and include the following:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_public_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORE_ID=your_store_id
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
